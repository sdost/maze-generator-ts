#Maze Generator

A simple maze generator/solver written in Typescript based on an earlier project written in Actionscript.

Running code hosted through Github Pages @ https://sdost.github.io/maze-generator-ts/

##Description

The main goal of this project was to create a displayable version of the original ActionScript project, and I chose TypeScript because of its uncanny similarity to AS3. Along the way I ended up expanded the scope of the project to encompass more advanced usages of Canvas and experimenting with Web Workers.

##Next Steps

* Cleanup the UI
