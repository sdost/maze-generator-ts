#Maze Generator

A simple maze generator/solver written in Typescript based on an earlier project written in Actionscript.

Running code hosted through Github Pages @ https://sdost.github.io/maze-generator-ts/

##Description

The main goal of this project was to create a displayable version of the original ActionScript project, and I chose TypeScript because of its uncanny similarity to AS3. Along the way I ended up expanded the scope of the project to encompass more advanced usages of Canvas and experimenting with Web Workers. I have also been discovering more about the limitations of modern browsers. As such, the current implementation actually doesn't work in Safari, but works very well in Firefox and Chrome. I am currently trying to find a way to balance the speed and compatability.

##Next Steps

* Cleanup the UI
* Think about using WebGL?
* Compatibility with Safari
